I make interesting things
=========================
That&#39;s pretty much the sole criterion for how I decide what projects to work on.  I never worry about not having an answer when people ask me *&quot;what&#39;s the point of that?&quot;*â€”I work on things that I find interesting and that strategy has served me well over the years.

I am currently working for Cosaic (@allen-ciq) on their ChartIQ product and learning a lot from my team.  I'm a git journeyman, and a vim enthusiast; I spend most of my time in a terminal emulator.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on reworking some of my old projects to bring the up to date with everything I've learned in the last 8 years.  I'm also developing a new Geek Code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Webpack, Web Components, and GRC's SQRL.
